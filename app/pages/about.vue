        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Why We Started</h2>
        <p>
          We saw a gap in the market for a platform that not only connects people but also provides the tools necessary for a successful mentoring relationship. From secure video calls to integrated scheduling and AI-powered matching, we've built iMentorsPro to be the all-in-one solution for professional growth.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-10 mb-4">Our Community</h2>
        <p>
          Today, iMentorsPro is home to thousands of mentors and coaches from top companies like Google, Meta, and Netflix, as well as independent experts and entrepreneurs. Our mentees are equally diverse, ranging from students and early-career professionals to senior executives looking to level up.
